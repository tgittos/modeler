- UV mapping works as follows: algorithm unwraps 3D object into flat meshes. Points can be moved by user. Then we'd need to save this map somewhere. Map is normalized, 0 - 1 width/height. User paints 2d square texture file to match the unwrapped mesh. Texture is also normalized, 0 - 1 width/height. When it comes to apply the texture to the mesh, the map represents which vertex goes where on the map.
