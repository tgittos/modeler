Now in order of importance!

Immediate
---------

- Replace sylvester.js and glUtils.js with mjs [done]
- Move translation and rotation functions from Cube into Face3 [done]
- Review and fix translation/rotation math once it's in Face3, perhaps make it chainable [done]
- Implement a Face3 vertex array to matrix function (for rotation and translation). Also consider 
  just storing vertices as a Matrix rather than an array. Length will be fixed -> Face3 = 3x3
  matrix, Face4 = 3x4 matrix. [done]
- Finish pyramid primitive [done]
- Create event framework so that code can be asynchronous
- Write more unit tests
- Move the inspect method off of each object and into a util
- Fix the dead load method on the shader loader so shaders can be stored as files
- Implement weldVertices method to cut down on geometry sent to GPU
- Add pyramid primitive and get demo file working again
- Review tight coupling of graphics object classes and the renderer. Decouple for the ability to
  add different kinds of rendering (canvas, for example). This will involve moving each object's
  getForRender method out and into some sort of switch/map in the WebGLRenderer.
- Implement per face colouring for materials, maybe as low as per vertex
- Continue on with learningwebgl.com lessons - current lesson is 5

Future
------

- Implement render to texture
- Look into hard-core optimisation of code to make it super fast
